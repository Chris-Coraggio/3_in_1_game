1 Problem Statement (20 points)

					

Clear and well-defined problem statement.

**Problem Statement:**

Have you ever wanted to play your favorite classics games but didnâ€™t want to download a new app for each one of them? Do you want all your games to be in one convenient app? Do you have the physical game but no one to play with? Currently there is no single app that combines all the classics from our childhoods forcing us to download a new app for each of those games. Our goal is to create an app that gives users access to a myriad of classic games as well as a computer to play these games with.
