Chris Coraggio, Muhammad Hamza Farrukh, Brad Howell, Rizwanulla Mohammed, Syed Ahad Sagheer

**Problem Statement:**

					

Many classic games have been ported over to mobile apps for users to pass the time. For a user to fully enjoy the nostalgia and entertainment offered by these games, they must commit a significant portion of device memory to these applications. We aim to solve this issue by creating one centralized application that bundles together three classic games: Connect Four, Tic-Tac-Toe, and Hangman, in order to provide users a fun experience while saving space on their phones. 

Furthermore, the majority of these applications are only available in single player platforms. In the current digital age we live in, users are craving connection with their peers. Our application aims to meet this need by providing an online multiplayer experience that will allow our users to share their favorite classic games with their friends.

					

2 Background Information (5 points)

					

A short paragraph about the history behind the problem at hand. Explain why this is an issue and why your team is attempting to solve this issue.

Background: 

Mobile gaming is an important and significant part of our lives that isn’t as convenient or as simple as it should be. In order to play some our favorite games, such as connect 4, hangman, or tic-tac-toe, we need to devote a significant portion of device memory to download several apps. Many of these mobile games are also limited to either singleplayer or multiplayer. Our product is a centralized Android application that bundles three classic games into a single app. We will also allow users to play both singleplayer and multiplayer. 

3 Environment					

A short paragraph pertaining detail about your development environment. This may include the language you will be coding in, external resources and libraries, databases, etc.

We will focus on creating an android application using Android Studio and will be coding in Java. Our server will be written in Javascript using nodeJS and will be deployed on Heroku. 

4 Functional Requirements (35 points)

					

A list of functional requirements of your software product. Your product should be approximately 2500 lines of code or more – not counting comments or blank lines, that is 2500 actual lines of code or more.
