# Problem Statement
Many classic games have been ported over to mobile apps for users to pass the time. For a user to fully enjoy the nostalgia and entertainment offered by these games, they must commit a significant portion of device memory to these applications. We aim to solve this issue by creating one centralized application that bundles together three classic games: Connect Four, Tic-Tac-Toe, and Hangman, in order to provide users a fun experience while saving space on their phones. 

Furthermore, the majority of these applications are only available in single player platforms. In the current digital age we live in, users are craving connection with their peers. Our application aims to meet this need by providing an online multiplayer experience that will allow our users to share their favorite classic games with their friends.
					
# Background Information

Mobile gaming is an important and significant part of our lives that isnâ€™t as convenient or as simple as it should be. In order to play some our favorite games, such as connect 4, hangman, or tic-tac-toe, we need to devote a significant portion of device memory to download several apps. Many of these mobile games are also limited to either singleplayer or multiplayer. Our product is a centralized Android application that bundles three classic games into a single app. We will also allow users to play both singleplayer and multiplayer.
